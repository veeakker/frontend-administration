# What is here?

The components here are tied to the domain model in a generic way.  They
don't specifically bind to one domain model or another, but they are
attached to the broad domain being discussed here.  As such, these may
make assumptions about the way we want this particular application to
interact.

The distinction between Ui and Ux is not very crisp, it might change
over time, or be dropped completely.
